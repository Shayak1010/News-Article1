            <p>Atishi Marlena Singh's appointment as Delhi's Chief Minister, succeeding Arvind Kejriwal, brings mixed reactions. From a governance perspective, this move can be seen as positive. Atishi is known for her progressive policies, particularly in education, where she significantly improved Delhi's government schools and introduced innovative programs like the "Happiness Curriculum."</p>
            
            <h2>Continuity of Governance</h2>
            <p>On the positive side, Atishi's track record, particularly in education and public welfare, suggests she is well-suited for leadership. Her initiatives like reforming Delhi's government schools and promoting affordable healthcare have earned widespread praise. She has proven to be an effective administrator, which could mean continuity of the policies that have made AAP popular, especially with lower-income groups.</p>

            <h2>Opposition Criticism</h2>
            <p>However, her rise to power comes at a politically tumultuous time. Kejriwal's resignation amid legal issues places her under intense scrutiny. The BJP’s claims that she is a "puppet CM" raise concerns about her autonomy and decision-making power, which could affect her ability to govern independently.</p>

            <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>
            <p>Ultimately, Atishi’s ability to step out of Kejriwal's shadow and assert herself as a strong, independent leader will be critical in determining whether she can successfully navigate these challenges and gain broader public trust.</p>
